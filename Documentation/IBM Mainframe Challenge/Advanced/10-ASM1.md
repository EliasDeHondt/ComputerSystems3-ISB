## ✨Steps

### 👉Step 1: Connect through SSH

- Open a terminal.
- Run the following command to connect to the USS server:
    ```bash
    ssh zxxxxx@204.90.115.200
    # if you did not complete it USS1, you need to run the following command:
    uss-setup
    ```
- You will now be asked for your password, which is the same password you used to log into the z/OS system through `VSCode`.

### 👉Step 2: Make the numbers

- Navigate using the USS section of VSCode to /z/public/assembler/ and find the example source file: `fibonacci.s`.
- Copy this to a subdirectory of your home directory called `assembly`.
```bash
cd ~ && mkdir assembly && cp /z/public/assembler/fibonacci.s ~/assembly && cd ~/assembly
```
- The first thing you need to do is compile the source code fibonacci.s to a binary file.
```bash
as -o fibonacci.o fibonacci.s
```
- The next step is to create an executable file where the object file is linked with required libraries.
```bash
ld -o fibonacci fibonacci.o
```
- Assuming no errors from the linkage process, execute the program by simply typing the name of the executable file.
```bash
./fibonacci
```

### 👉Step 3: Finished

- Now submit the job `CHKASM1` from `ZXP.PUBLIC.JCL` to validate the correct output from code (`CC`) of `0000`.
- Or `tsocmd submit "'ZXP.PUBLIC.JCL(CHKASM1)'"`.
