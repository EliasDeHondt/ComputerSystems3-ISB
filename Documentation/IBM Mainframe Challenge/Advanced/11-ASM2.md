## ✨Steps

### 👉Step 1: Connect through SSH

- Open a terminal.
- Run the following command to connect to the USS server:
    ```bash
    ssh zxxxxx@204.90.115.200
    # if you did not complete it USS1, you need to run the following command:
    uss-setup
    ```
- You will now be asked for your password, which is the same password you used to log into the z/OS system through `VSCode`.














### 👉Step 3: Finished

- Now submit the job `CHKASM2` from `ZXP.PUBLIC.JCL` to validate the correct output from code (`CC`) of `0000`.
